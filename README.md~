LS-affine-transformation-estimation
===================================

Affine transformation estimation by means of Least Square method, implemented in C++ with OpenCV (tested on Microsoft Windows with OpenCV 2.4.4).

The estimation is based on the article:
SPÃ„TH, Helmuth. Fitting affine and orthogonal transformations between two sets of points. Mathematical Communications, 2004, 9.1: 27-34.
